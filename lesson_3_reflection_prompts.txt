When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Remote repositories are useful for collaboration because they allow multiple people to access the same code set and
update it. They can either start their own branch or make contributions that the original creator of the project can
choose to accept. Remote repositories also may be useful if you're working on multiple computers. You can push your 
latest code to the repository, then later when working on another computer, pull it from the repository onto that 
computer.
